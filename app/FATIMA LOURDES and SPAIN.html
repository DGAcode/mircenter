        <p class="text">
          A rugged mountain is home to one of the most popular pilgrimage destinations in Spain: the Shrine of Our Lady of Montserrat.
          Since the 12th century, pilgrims have been drawn to the mountain to venerate the miraculous statue of the Black
          Madonna (La Moreneta). Millions of pilgrims visit Montserrat every year. We will enjoy a tour of Monserrat and
          then travel to Zaragoza. Upon arrival, we visit one of the world's largest Marian Shrines, Our Lady of the Pillar.
          The pillar, given by Our Lady to St. James, Spain's patron saint, gives off an extraordinary fragrance. This place
          visited by Our Lady before her Assumption, offers visitors a glimpse of the Holy Land. Dinner and overnight in

        <p class="text">
          Depart for Avila, the home of St Teresa. We will enjoy a five hour visit. Ávila is a medieval city in western Spain, about
          70 miles northwest of Madrid. Founded in the 11th century to protect the Spanish territories from the Moors, Ávila
          has a magnificently well-preserved city wall, a historic cathedral, a number of Romanesque churches, and an authentic
          medieval atmosphere. For all these reasons, the entire Old Town of Ávila has been designated a World Heritage Site
          by UNESCO. For pilgrims, the city of Ávila is important because of its association with the great mystic and reformer
          St. Teresa de Jesus, better known as St. Teresa of Ávila. Teresa was a 16th-century Carmelite nun who reformed
          her order, had many ecstatic visions, and wrote several books. She is the female patron saint of Spain and was
          the first woman to be named a Doctor of the Church. Ávila contains two main shrines honoring St. Teresa, along
          with a few more sites associated with the saint. The primary shrine is the Convento de Santa Teresa (Convent of
          St. Teresa), a convent contains her relics, and the second is the Monasterio de la Encarnacion, where St. Teresa
          lived and where her cell can be visited. Return to Madrid for dinner and overnight. Optional Flamenco show.
        </p>

        <h6 class="subtitle">DAY 11 MADRID - USA</h6>
