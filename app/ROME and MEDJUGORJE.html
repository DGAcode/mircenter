          Wake up in Eternal City, one of the greatest centers of Western Civilization and the first truly cosmopolitan city on earth!
          It is also spiritual capital for all the Catholics around the world. Today is truly a day we will have in our minds
          for many years to come. This morning we go to Vatican City to attend the weekly Papal Audience or Blessing given
          by His Holiness Pope Francis (pending papal schedule). Following, visit the Vatican Museums, a group of most impressive
          edifices with hundreds of galleries filled with art treasures. See awe-inspiring relics and works of art donated
          throughout centuries as tributes of faith. We'll cover The Tapestry Gallery, The Raphael Rooms and the most overwhelming
          Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo's Masterpiece, restored mural of the Last Judgment. Later, enter the largest church
          in Christendom St Peter's Basilica, built on the site where St Peter was martyred. Unsurpassed in beauty, a monument
          to the long history of the Catholic Church, to which pilgrims come from around the world, St Peter's is the grandest
          of the world's churches. Marvel Pieta and Bernini's amazing bronze canopy. We will also visit the grave of Pope
          John Paul II located at the Vatican. Dinner and overnight in your hotel.

          apparition. In 1933 the villagers built a 30’ high cross on the anniversary of Jesus’ crucifixion on top of Cross
          Mountain (Krizevac). We will climb the mountain through the Stations of the Cross. Also, visit and pray at “Blue
          Cross”. A place of healings and graces at the foot of Apparition Hill. We will have the chance to attend meetings
          and talks with the visionaries (subject to their availability and health during our trip). We will also visit the
