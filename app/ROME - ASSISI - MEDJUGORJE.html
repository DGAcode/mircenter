          where the visionaries first saw Our Blessed Virgin Mary. Pray before the statue that symbolizes
          the place of the first apparition. In 1933 the villagers built a 30’ high cross on the anniversary of Jesus’
          crucifixion on top of Cross Mountain. We will climb the mountain through the Stations of the Cross.
          Also, visit and pray at “Blue Cross”. A place of healings and graces at the foot of Apparition Hill. We
          will have the chance to attend meetings and talks with the visionaries (subject to their availability and
          health during our trip). We will also visit the community of Cenacolo (a rehab center). In the evening,
          we can join the villagers at 5:00pm (or 6:00pm daylight savings time) to pray the rosary. Followed by
          Croatian Mass during which there is the blessing of the items you have with you. Adoration takes place
          on Wednesdays and Saturdays later in the evening, and veneration of the Holy Cross takes place on
          Fridays later in the evening. We will also have time for personal prayer and reflection.
